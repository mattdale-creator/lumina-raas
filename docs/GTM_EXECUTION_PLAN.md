## Risk Mitigation

| Compute costs exceed projections | Medium | Medium | BYOK option, batch processing, model switching |
| Key competitor copies RaaS model | Low | Medium | Speed to market, Aether moat, community lock-in |

## Decision Gates

- **Week 8:** If <100 waitlist signups → pivot messaging, not product
- **Week 12:** If <5 paid outcomes → extend free pilot, add more handholding
- **Week 20:** If CAC >$800 → pause paid ads, double down on organic
- **Week 26:** If <$100k ARR → consider niche vertical focus or fundraise
