# Lumina RaaS — Investor Pitch Deck
## Results-as-a-Service Platform

---

## Slide 1: Title
**Lumina RaaS**
We deliver your complete software business — or you pay nothing.

*Results-as-a-Service for Rapid Company Launch*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
- Building a production SaaS MVP takes **6–18 months** and **$10k–$50k+**
- Solo founders and small teams can't afford dedicated dev, QA, DevOps, and maintenance
- Traditional tools stop at code generation — no one handles the full lifecycle
- Writing specs and reviewing AI outputs has become the new bottleneck

**Every founder we talk to says the same thing:**
> "I spent 12 months and $40k just to get a basic version live."

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
**Lumina RaaS orchestrates 12 specialised AI agents across every software path required to launch a company.**

- Define your desired outcome (e.g., "production MVP with payments")
- Our agents autonomously build, test, and deploy using persistent Ralph loops
- Code self-tweaks until every success criterion is met
- **You pay nothing until the result is live and verified**

---

## Slide 4: How It Works
```
Customer defines outcome → AI agents activate across 12 PRDs →
Ralph loops self-refine code → Outcome delivered & verified →
Payment triggered only on success
```

**12 Modular PRDs cover:**
Marketing Site → Infrastructure → CI/CD → Database → Auth → APIs →
Dashboard → Payments → Notifications → Analytics → Admin → Monitoring

Plus **Aether**: Autonomous AI sales agent for customer acquisition

---

## Slide 5: Market Opportunity
- Global AI agents market: **$7.8B (2025) → $52–139B by 2030** (CAGR 40–46%)
- Multi-agent systems growing fastest at **~48% CAGR**
- Gartner predicts **40% of enterprise apps** will embed AI agents by end of 2026
- **>2 million** global early-stage startups in 2026
