## Direct Competitors

### 1. Cursor (Anysphere)
| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **What it is** | AI-powered IDE (VS Code fork) with deep code understanding |
| **Pricing** | Free → Pro $20/mo → Pro+ $60/mo → Ultra $200/mo |
| **Model** | Credit-based consumption on frontier models |
| **Valuation** | ~$9.9B (2025 round) |
| **Strengths** | Best-in-class IDE integration, huge user base, strong dev community |
| **Weaknesses** | Negative gross margins on heavy users ($100–500+/mo API costs), interactive only (not autonomous), code-only scope |
| **Lumina Advantage** | Full lifecycle (not just code), autonomous execution, pay-per-result eliminates risk |

### 2. Replit Agent
| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **What it is** | Browser-native full-stack builder with integrated hosting |
| **Pricing** | $25/mo base + usage credits |
| **Model** | Subscription + consumption |
| **Strengths** | Zero setup, great for beginners, instant deploy, education market |
| **Weaknesses** | Less enterprise-grade security, limited multi-agent collaboration, locked to Replit ecosystem |
| **Lumina Advantage** | Enterprise security (Clerk, Supabase RLS), open stack, 12-PRD full coverage, Aether sales agent |

### 3. Cognition Devin
| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **What it is** | Fully autonomous AI software engineer |
| **Pricing** | ~$20/mo + pay-as-you-go (enterprise $500+/mo) |
| **Model** | Task-based with credits |
| **Strengths** | Highest autonomy, end-to-end task completion, strong at research/debugging |
| **Weaknesses** | Occasional "off-track" behaviour, requires human intervention on complex tasks, limited public adoption data |
| **Lumina Advantage** | 12-PRD structure provides guardrails, Ralph loops with explicit success criteria prevent drift, RaaS billing model |

### 4. GitHub Copilot Workspace
| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|

| **Pricing** | Included in Copilot ($10–39/mo) |
| **Model** | Subscription |
| **Strengths** | Native GitHub integration, massive distribution, Microsoft backing |
| **Weaknesses** | Tied to GitHub ecosystem, not fully autonomous, no deployment/monitoring |
| **Lumina Advantage** | Complete company launch (not just PRs), includes payments, analytics, sales — far broader scope |

### 5. Bolt / Lovable / v0

## Lumina RaaS Moat / Differentiation

1. **Results-as-a-Service model** — No competitor offers pay-only-on-verified-delivery. This eliminates customer risk entirely.

2. **12-PRD full lifecycle** — Competitors handle pieces; Lumina covers everything from marketing site to monitoring.

3. **Ralph loops with explicit success criteria** — Self-improving code that iterates until measurable targets are met. Prevents the "off-track" problem that plagues Devin.

4. **Aether autonomous sales agent** — No competitor includes a customer acquisition tool. Lumina sells itself.

5. **Outcome-based pricing** — Aligned incentives: Lumina only profits when the customer succeeds.

## Threats & Mitigation

| Threat | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Cursor adds autonomous mode | High | Lumina's scope is much broader (12 PRDs vs code) |
| Replit adds enterprise features | Medium | Lumina already has Clerk, Stripe, Supabase, RLS |
| Devin drops price further | Medium | RaaS model is fundamentally different — risk-free |
| New entrant with RaaS model | Low (now) | First-mover advantage, Aether network effects |
| AI compute costs increase | Low | BYOK option passes costs through; margins improve as models get cheaper |
| Regulation of AI calls (Aether) | Medium | Australian compliance already built in; adapt per jurisdiction |

## Key Takeaway

Lumina RaaS occupies a unique position: **the only platform that delivers complete company-launch outcomes with zero upfront customer risk, self-improving code, and built-in autonomous sales.** The competitive moat is the combination of scope + pricing model + self-improvement — not any single feature.
