# Ralph Loop Task: Maximize Landing Page Conversion

## Context
Lumina RaaS landing page at `app/page.tsx`. Read `progress.txt` for status.

## Task
Optimize the landing page for maximum conversion rate:

1. **Social Proof** — Add a "results delivered" counter and 3 testimonial cards (placeholder content is fine, but make it look real)
2. **Urgency** — Add a "Limited beta spots remaining" banner below the hero
3. **Trust Signals** — Add security badges, "SOC2-ready", "256-bit encryption", "AU data residency"
4. **Clearer Value Prop** — Add a "Before vs After" comparison section (Traditional Dev vs Lumina RaaS)
5. **Video Placeholder** — Add a mock video embed section (dark card with play button) for "Watch 90-second demo"
6. **Exit Intent** — Add a subtle floating CTA bar that appears on scroll past the hero
7. **Faster CTA** — The main CTA should be more prominent. Make it pulse/glow subtly with animation.
8. **Micro-copy** — Add reassurance text under every CTA: "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime", "Free pilot included"
9. **Loading Performance** — Lazy load below-the-fold sections, optimize font loading
10. **A/B Test Ready** — Add data attributes to key CTAs for future analytics tracking

## Success Criteria
- All 10 improvements implemented
- `npm run build` succeeds
- Page loads in < 2 seconds (check with Lighthouse)
- All new sections are mobile responsive
- Write COMPLETE to progress.txt when done
